The tariff rates will increase from their current levels to between 25% and 40%, impacting an estimated $85 billion in trade. The measures, based on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, are set to take effect on April 1, 2025, and will remain in place for one year. The administration cited intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices as the primary justifications for these actions. Certain exemptions apply, including components used in medical equipment and defense applications."
